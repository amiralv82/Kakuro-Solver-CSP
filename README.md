Here’s a polished and professional README.md file for your Kakuro Puzzle Solver project, suitable for GitHub:

🔢 Kakuro Puzzle Solver

This Python project provides an intelligent solver for Kakuro puzzles using Backtracking Search enhanced with heuristics like Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) and Least Constraining Value (LCV). It features a command-line interface that allows users to select difficulty levels and solving strategies.

📌 Features
	•	✅ Backtracking search algorithm
	•	🧠 Heuristic enhancements: MRV and LCV for smarter decisions
	•	🎮 Multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert
	•	🔁 Step-by-step puzzle state visualization
	•	🧪 Modular, extensible design for future improvements

🧩 What is Kakuro?

Kakuro is a logic puzzle that combines elements of Sudoku and crosswords. Players must fill white cells with digits (1-9) so that the sum matches the clues in the black cells. Each sequence must use unique digits.

🛠️ How It Works
	1.	Puzzle Representation:
	•	Grid-based structure with three cell types:
	•	BLACK cells: Blocked, unused
	•	CLUE cells: Contain sum targets for horizontal/vertical sequences
	•	WHITE cells: Fillable with digits 1-9
	2.	Backtracking Search:
	•	Recursively tries valid combinations
	•	Checks for consistency with clue sums and uniqueness
	3.	Heuristics (optional):
	•	LCV (Least Constraining Value): Picks values that limit future choices the least
	•	MRV (Minimum Remaining Values): Picks clues with the fewest unassigned cells first

🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.x

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kakuro-solver.git
cd kakuro-solver

Running the Solver

python kakuro_solver.py

You will be prompted to:
	1.	Choose a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert)
	2.	Choose a heuristic (Standard or Heuristic-enhanced)
	3.	Watch the puzzle solve itself step-by-step
